compiler: g++ # Change to whatever will compile your c/c++ code. You can even use emscripten!
name: App name # The name of the project, used for debugging.

# These are the flags that will be passed to the compiler, such as -std=c++17

# The c/c++ files that will be compiled in order. 
files: 
    - src/utils.cpp
    - src/main.cpp

# Where are the header files located?
includes:
   - src/include/

# Not to be confused with libraries, these are the paths to the libraries.
# libs:
#     - path/to/lib

# These are the libraries that will be linked to the project. Path must be specified in libs.
# libraries: 
#    - libname

# Shell commands to run before or after building.
# This is more (CMake) style, where you can run shell commands before building. 
# Also, you can run shell commands after building.
shell:
    after:
        - app.exe # Usually you want to run the program after building it.
        - del app.exe
